The learning algorithm receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs, and the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors. It then modifies the model accordingly."

    "Overfitting happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This problem can be addressed by pruning a tree after it has learned in order to remove some of the detail it has picked up. Pruning is a technique in machine learning that reduces the size of decision trees by removing sections of the tree that provide little power to classify instances."
